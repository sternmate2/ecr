Hi and welcome to the BioData Test Repo
This is a short test to get a bit of insight on our future work together.

Clone the repo
Refactor the Dockerfiles to use docker best practices
Create a GHA to build and push the docker images to AWS ECR that can build in less than 3 minutes even with a large Gemfile and many dependencies
Bonus: create GTA static analysis that are recommended for Docker images
The outcome
A PR to the repo with instructin about the setup required on AWS and Github to allow it to work.

Some last notes
You are welcome to add in the PR some sample code that will make the docker build actually succeed :)

After the test we will have another short session to discuss the PR.
